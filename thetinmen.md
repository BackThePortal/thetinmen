> The Tin Men are not anti-women.
If you think we are and that's why you're here, then you are going to be disappointed.
We love, admire and support **women**, and we love, admire and support **men**.
            <p>Yes, there are members on both sides that get things wrong &mdash; <u>but that is on them and _**them** alone_.</u></p>
			<p>We do not condemn entire genders by the actions of individuals, or groups of individuals.</p>
			<p>This is a trap many feminists and MRAs fall into.</p>
			<p><u>**_But not us._**</u></p>
			<p>It is true that we speak almost entirely about issues that affect men and boys.</p>
			<p>But that is only because there are so many more places that speak exclusively about the issues that affect women.</p>
			<p>We are here to balance this conversation, not to deny the existence of women's issues.</p>
			<p>We are not MRAs. We are not feminists.</p>
			<p><u>We are [@TheTinMen](https://www.instagram.com/thetinmen/).</u>"</p>
